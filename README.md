## Morning Lab - Problem solving

### printGreeting

Write a function called `printGreeting` with a parameter `name` that returns a greeting with the argument **interpolated** into the greeting.

```javascript
console.log(printGreeting("Slimer"));
```

> => Hello there, Slimer!

<br>

### reverseWordOrder

Write a function `reverseWordOrder` that accepts a single argument, a string. The function should return a string with the order of the words reversed. Don't worry about punctuation.

```javascript
console.log(reverseWordOrder("Ishmael me Call"));
```

> => "Call me Ishmael"


```
console.log(reverseWordOrder("I use Lâncome on my comb"));
```

> => "comb my on Lâncome use I"

### calculate

Write a function called `calculate`.

This function should take three arguments, two numbers and a string.

Name the parameters `num1`, `num2`, and `operation`.

If the function receives the string "add" for the operation parameter, it will return the sum of num1 and num2.

If the function receives the string "sub" for the operation parameter, it will return num1 minus num2.

Do the same thing for multiplication "mult", division "div", and exponent "exp" (where num2 is the exponent of num1).

```javascript
console.log(calculate(4, 3, "sub"));

=> 1
```

```javascript
console.log(calculate(4, 3, "exp"));

=> 64
```

### pandigital numbers

A number of length n is _1-to-n pandigital_ if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once.

- The number `15234` is _1-to-n pandigital_.

- The number `333` is **not** _1-to-n pandigital_.

- The number `0` is **not** _1-to-n pandigital_.

- The number `987654321` is _1-to-n pandigital_.


Write a function that checks if a number is _1-to-n pandigital_.

### printGreeting v2.0

There is a very rudimentary JavaScript function for receiving user input called prompt().  

Usage: 

```
	var userInput = prompt("Please enter some input");
```

> `userInput` is now whatever the user entered.

There is another rudimentary JavaScript function for displaying text called alert(). You probably have heard of it. It takes a string as a parameter. Read about it on mdn.

Let's revisit your printGreeting.

First get the userinput as above. Then write a function called `printGreeting2` with a parameter `name` that returns a greeting with the argument interpolated into the greeting as before, but this time use the alert function to display the greeting to the user.

### Palindrome

Writing a function to determine if a word is a Palindrome.

Pseudo-code and work in layers, one layer at a time. Don't jump ahead until each piece has been tested and works.

* reverse the word (how?)
* check if the word is the same as the reverse (how?)
* return true or false
